# Role default lower priority variables

# List of dicts with logical volumes to configure. The dicts have the same
# attributes that the ones expected by the ansible lvol module. For example:
#
# lvm_lv:
#   - vg: firefly
#     lv: test
#     size: 512
#     pvs: /dev/sda,/dev/sdb
#

lvm_lv: []

# Dicitionary with the defaults options to use if no other ones are specified in
# the `lvm_lv` variable. The members of the dict are the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible lvol module

lvm_lv_defaults:
  state: present

# Indicate `lvm_lv` must be loaded also from host variables. Any host variable
# that begins with "lvm_lv_*" and contains the necessary attributes
# will be loaded as an item to manage by the role. The variables must follow the
# structure detailed before for `lvm_lv`

lvm_lv_load_from_hostvars: no
